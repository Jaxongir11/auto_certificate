Electronic certificate preparation program
The information of the listeners is loaded into the program from a file with the file extension ".csv" prepared in advance, and certificates with the file extension ".docx" and ".pdf" are created based on the data in each line. A separate QR code is created and placed inside each certificate.
The program is based on the modern programming language Python and its various libraries, which allows working in a user-friendly window.
